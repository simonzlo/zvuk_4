      <p>Brian Fairley, PhD candidate in Ethnomusicology at New York University. His dissertation, «Dissected Listening: a Media History of Georgian Polyphonic Recording,» investigates <br>the early history of multi-channel recordings of Georgian folk and sacred music, while exploring the media implications <br>of polyphony as musical form and metaphor</p>
      <p>Peter McMurray, lecturer in Ethnomusicology at University <br>of Cambridge. His research focuses primarily on Islam, sound and migration. He is currently finishing a book and film project, Pathways to God: The Islamic Acoustics of Turkish Berlin. <br>He is also interested in South Slavic oral poetry and histories of recording technology.</p>
      <p>What does it mean to capture a single voice within an ensemble? What kind of listening is made possible through techniques of separation and isolation, such as those that became common with the advent of multitrack tape? <br>And what kind of music lends itself to these techniques?</p>
      <p>In this presentation, Brian Fairley (New York University) discusses a little - known landmark in the history of sound recording: the wax cylinders recorded by Evgeny Gippius <br>in 1930 and 1935, which used three phonographs recording simultaneously to isolate individual singers in a choir. <br>The singers were part of an ethnographic ensemble from Guria, a region in Western Georgia, whose complex, multipart music has fascinated researchers for over a century. <br>By understanding the intellectual and political context in which these recordings were made — and the twists of fate which have left them virtually unknown today — the outlines <br>of an alternative history of multitrack recording come into view. In his response, Peter McMurray (University of Cambridge) reflects on processes of inscription and multisensory perception, with reference to media documents from <br>the Milman Parry Collection of Oral Literature.</p>
